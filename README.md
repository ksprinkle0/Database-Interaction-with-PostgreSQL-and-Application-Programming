How to run:
  - make sure you have installed Java and Driver (I used eclipse so the driver in included in my project folder)
  - create schema on pgAdmin using the A3Q1.sql file
  - open main file and delete first line "package comp3005A3;" if not using a package in eclipse
  - change url, username, and password if differnt on your device
  - run program and uncomment the functions as needed
